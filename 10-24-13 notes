What are we going to make?
- a reproducible program (a model-ETAS, Stark, Poisson), (data-where from, fomrats), (inputs/outputs?), (github, laptop, amazon webservices)
- paper (abstract, intro, methodds, results (negative results), citations)
- public understanding of science (update wikipedia)

Data Curators (From now until next Tuesday)
- Where do we want to get the data from? (Southern California Earthquake Data Center)
- Do we want to work with the entire planet or stick with what we foud?
- Keep the scope small and local

Analyzers
- Create a workflow skeleton that we would take from curators and give to visualizers
- Need input for workflow


Visualizers
- Appeal to audience

Presenters
-Find relevant works/literature/citations to send out.
