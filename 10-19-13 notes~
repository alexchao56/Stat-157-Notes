DC-Geographic, Time Period, Formats, Data Sources

Analyzers- ETAS Model. Inputs to Model

Visualizers-Graphs? Tools? IPYNB or D3?

Presenters-Story, Big Picture, Output Format, Presentation

Some of us are in the land of Worry and Confusion
Others are in the state of Ambiguity and Questions

You want to get from the first land to the second. Ask more questions!

SMART GOALS- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bounds

ETAS = Epidemic Type Aftershock
- disease-based
- There are 4 input parameters

Our day:
10 mins -Standup
15 -20 mins -Lecture
WORK IN GROUPS
15-20 mins Summary and Next Steps

Hypotheses- use the MDA model to get the same level of accuracy as the ETAS model with X percent fewer models
We're saying that the ETAS model is complicated and not necessary 

Create a model simpler than ETAS that makes the same predictions
