Philip Stark lecture

Looking at whether weather is predictive of earthquakes.
SAMSI

Simple rules that require fewer parameters.
ETAS(?)

Do earthquakes really have probabilities? 
Rabbit Axioms
- Can't turn a rate into a probability without assuming the phenomenon is random in the first place


What would make the casino metaphor apt?
1. the physics of earthquakes might be stochastic
2. stochastic models might provide a compact, accurate description of earthquake phenomenology
3. stochastic models might be useful for predicing future seismicity

Seimicity models
- poisson. Clearly doesn't fit: too litle clustering
- poisson for "declustered" catalogs". will pass if you remove enough events. How few events can you remove? Standard algorithms don't work
- gamma renewal. doesn't fit. 
- ETAS doesn't fit.

Are reclustered approixmately Poisson?
- Examine SCEC data; test for temporal and spatiotemporal Poisson behavior 

Combinatorial optimization; computational complexity

Heuristic method- find a reasonable number of events to subtract

How to test whether events come from a Poisson process?
- if you observed it from time 0 to time T
- estimate lambda hat to be = #events / T
- suppose we divide this into equal length subintervals. The distribution of the events in intevals should be poisson. 
- some intervals should have some events, no events, or more
- do a chi-square test on that
- WRONG
- Homogeneous poisson process - expected rate is uniform
- conditional distribution of time of those events is the same as the order statistics of uniform iid random variables
- Do these look like 11 independent uniform random variables?
- Empirical cumulative distribution of the number of events
- Theoretical CDF would look like line with slope 1
- Non-parametric test: Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test. How much the max distance from empirical vs theoretical

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test
Assumes you fixed theoretical distributions beforehand

Automatic Alarms and MDAs (magnitude dependent alarms)
- everytime you see an event bigger than a threshold, turn on an alarm
- look at the level sets, take lower and lower level sets
- longer alarms for bigger events

Simulation is from an ETAS model

Try to find different parameters. Currently \tau * \mu^M
If we can find one, then we can become famous

What is ETAS?
- how do epidemics happen?
- Heuristic: some events are unpredicatble "background" mainshocks
- Two empirical relationships: Gutenberg-Richter law, Omori-Utsu law
- magnitude indepndent of time, same distribution for main and aftershock
- every event is a background event or has at most 1 parent

Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitudes
- N \propto 10^{-bM}
- best fitting parameter b varies regionally. 
- ETAS turns into a probability density: 
p(M|m_o) = b ln10 * 10^{-b(M-m_0)}

Omori-Utsu law
- \frac{\Delta N}{\delta t} \approx \frac{K}{(c+t)^p}
- integrating that would be tell you how many aftershocks

Using ETAS to predict
- estimate parameter on training data
- optimal predictor of stochastic process: conditonal intensity
- turn on alarms when the conditional intensity \lambda(t) is above some threshold
