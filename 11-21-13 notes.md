According to the USGS, earthquakes with magnitude 3 or lower are not very significant in that they do not cause much damage. 

Thus we might want to subset our data to only magnitudes greater than 3. 

We played around in R with plotting various these different things. 

Instead of creating a mathematical function to model the data, we will create an algorithm or heuristic (a sequence of steps, if/else statements) that will communicate what to do in the event on the earthquake. This will solely be based on the empirical data,and not on what fucntion we think best matches that. 


How we want to proceed:
Cap off a window and do analysis on that training data set.
