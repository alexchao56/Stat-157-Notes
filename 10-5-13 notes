Group A
Data curator --> Analysis Producer --> Visualization --> Presenter

Data curator-creating structure with the raw data. Works with other curators to make sure that data is in the same format
Analysis- coding a lot, using a lot of statistical analysis. Share techniques with other analyzers
Visualization - using tools to make the data more communicable 
Presenter- communicates the results. Needs to know what the questions are and aggregate information and put it together. Often is the research paper


Need to communiate well with people in your pipeline and with people outside of your pipeline. 


Traditionally Groups have been divided because of competition and unwillingness to share work. Future of science is that there is more collaboration. 


Questions:
What tools do we need?
What skills should we develop
what are our responsibilities?
What are our outputs?
How do we communicate with other groups?
How do we share techniques as a group?
What is our 'stack'? or workflow?
